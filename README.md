# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that utilizes **linear regression** to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and the age of the house.

---

## Features Used

-  Area (in square feet)
-  Number of Bedrooms
-  Age of the House (in years)

---

##  ML Workflow

1.  Data Collection
2.  Data Preprocessing
3.  Model Training (Linear Regression)
4.  Model Evaluation (MSE, R² Score)
5.  Prediction on new inputs

---

##  How to Run

1. Open the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload `housing_data.csv` or use the sample data
3. Run the notebook step-by-step
4. Input custom values to predict house price

##  Example Output

```text
Mean Squared Error: 625000000.00  
R² Score: 0.98

Predicted Price for [2200 sqft, 3 bedrooms, 6 years]: ₹40,00,000.00
